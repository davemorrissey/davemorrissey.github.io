                I am a full stack architect, technical lead and developer. I specialise in collaborating with business,
                product, and technical colleagues to design and deliver sustainable solutions for complex requirements
                in a timely manner, and ensuring their quality, reliability and security. I bring domain and technical
                knowledge to product discussions, together with attention to detail and experience of accessibility and UX,
                to assist in the refinement of requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have lead development teams as they delivered new features and ongoing technical improvements, providing
                detailed specifications as required together with background knowledge, guidance during development,
                code reviews, and assistance with testing and planning releases.
            </p>
            <p>
                I regularly liaise with colleagues in other product and enablement teams to define and share solutions
                to common issues, troubleshoot and rapidly resolve production problems, and plan the retirement of
                legacy hardware and software.
